## Challange Description
There are 2 arms fighting each other. They an gave attack and health ( can go farhter with having defence). Every unit will have the same stats. Since this is 1D they can only fight one at a time. Once one of the fighters die, the next in line can fight. This countinues until one of the armies are defeated. At the end of the game we can spit out the stats.
The outputs should never be the same.
